/**
 * Base Vite config for SvelteKit workspace apps whose package contract and
 * browser composition live at the app root, outside `src/`.
 *
 * The `fs.allow` entry is load-bearing, but not because of Vite's own
 * default. @sveltejs/kit's plugin sets fs.allow to the app `src/`, the app and
 * workspace-root `node_modules`, and its own output, and nothing else. That
 * omits the monorepo root, so the app-root composition files (the package
 * contract and browser entry that live outside `src/`) and sibling-package
 * source are unreadable in dev. Adding the workspace root restores both; Vite
 * concatenates it with SvelteKit's entries rather than replacing them. It is
 * also what lets a worker declared inside a workspace package load at all: its
 * `new URL('./x.worker.ts', import.meta.url)` resolves to a `/@fs/` URL under
 * the monorepo root, which SvelteKit's list answers 403 to.
 *
 * An app that needs more settings adds them with `mergeConfig`, which
 * concatenates arrays rather than replacing them.
